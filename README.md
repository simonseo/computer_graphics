# Computer Graphics (`CS-AD 216`)
##Course Description
This is a student repository for the course Foundations of Computer Graphics, taught by [Professor Saurabh Ray](http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~saurabh/) at [NYU Abu Dhabi](http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). The following is the course description:

>The aim of the course is to give an overview of the fundamental concepts in computer graphics along with hands-on experience in interactive 3D graphics programming. The course will cover basic mathematics related to computer graphics (geometric primitives, 2D and 3D transformations, orthographic and perspective projections),  fundamentals of geometric modeling (mesh representation and manipulation),  the modern graphics pipeline,  shading and lighting models, mapping techniques (texture, bump, shadow, environment), and ray tracing. Relevant basics of mathematics, algorithms and data structures will also be covered in this course. However, prior experience in programming will be very useful as the course is programming intensive. There will be several programming assignments.
