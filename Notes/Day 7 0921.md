#Day 7 - Linear Algebra

###Vector and Point Arithmetic
- `Point + Point`
- `Point - Point`
- `Point + Vector`
- `Point * Scalar`
- `Vector + Point`
- `Vector + Vector`
- `Vector * Scalar`

###Linear combination / dependence
- The sum of vectors multiplied by some scalar is a linear combination of such vectors.
- They are linearly dependent if any one vector can be described as a linear combination of all others.
- They are lineary independent if none can be.

###Affine combination
- The sum of vectors multiplied by some scalars each, which sums to 1, is an affine combination
- The affine combination of two points is the line connecting the two points.

###Convex combination
- The affine combination whose coefficients are non-negative is called covex combination.
- The convex combination of two points is the line segment and such of more points is the convex hull.

###Dot Product
- u . v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(theta)
- in any orthonormal basis, regardless of the coordinate system, u.v = SUM(u_i * v_i)
- can be used as a measure of similarity - also used for machine learning, by seeing things as vectors
- distance between point and plane: `(q-p0).n/||n||`

###Cross Product
- a x b is a vector orthogonal to both a and b given by the right hand rule.
- Interpretations: the absolute value of cross products of two vectors is the area of a parallelogram formed by the vectors
- anti commutative: a x b = - b x a
