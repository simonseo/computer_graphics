Billboarding - create the illusion of a 3D object by pasting 2D picture on a board.
Trick, usually used in games. Don't want to render all objects. Make a "Billboard" that always faces the camera.
Objects can be viewplane facing or viewpoint facing. 

Billboard Cloud - take a lot of photos from different angles. 

Half Edge Data Structure
all edges have directions in both directions.
take the halfpoint of one direction.
each half edge node stores the halfpoint of the same edge in the other direction, (pair)
face the fase on right?
You can "delete" faces with it

Curve simplicifcation
Ramer-Douglas-Pecker: pick first and last points. draw a ljine, find the fartheset point and incorporate it.
Expansion to 3D. Thake the average of th norm

Edge collapse
take out points that have little cost: 
quadric error metric collapse - keep track of all the faces that have collapsed into the vertex.
