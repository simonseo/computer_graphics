#Day 5 - JavaScript overview

##Turtle Graphics, or L-systems (Lindenmayer system) (implemented by LoGo Language)

###Language
Parameters

- `s` unit distance
- `&Alpha;` unit angle

Turtle Configuration

- `x, y, theta`

Instructions

- `f` move forawrd by distance s
- `F` do f and draw line segment
- `+` turn left by angle theta
- `-` turn right by angle theta
- `[]` save configuration; do things inside the bracket and return

##Data Types in GLSL
####Scalars
The basic non-vector types are:

- `bool​`: conditional type, values may be either true or false
- `int​`: a signed, two's complement, 32-bit integer
- `uint​`: an unsigned 32-bit integer
- `float​`: an IEEE-754 single-precision floating point number
- `double​`: an IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point number

	**Warning**: The specific sizes and formats for integers and floats in GLSL are only for GLSL 1.30 and above. Lower versions of GLSL may not use these exact specifications.

####Vectors
Each of the scalar types, including booleans, have 2, 3, and 4-component vector equivalents. The n digit below can be 2, 3, or 4:

- `bvecn​`: a vector of booleans
- `ivecn​`: a vector of signed integers
- `uvecn​`: a vector of unsigned integers
- `vecn​`: a vector of single-precision floating-point numbers
- `dvecn​`: a vector of double-precision floating-point numbers

Vector values can have the same math operators applied to them that scalar values do. These all perform the component-wise operations on each component. However, in order for these operators to work on vectors, the two vectors must have the same number of components.
