##Animating shapes
###Frames
`requestAnimationFrame` is a `window` method that takes a callback function and when the browser is free, it calls the callback function and passes the time since the webpage was loaded in milliseconds as the argument of the callback function. `webglutils.js` provides the function `requestAnimFrame` in a cross-browser way. Here is how we would use it:

```js
requestAnimFrame(render);

function render(now) {
	requestAnimFrame(render);
	//something that depends on time (now)
}
```

This function is naturally only called once. To make an animation using it, you should recursively request the callback function. It does not matter that `requsetAnimFrame` is called in the beginning of the function `render` because this function only requests, not runs, the callback function. So the browser would process later code first and run the callback function when it is free.

###Using the shaders
We should rather only send the time to the shader (run in the GPU) and do the time dependent calculations there, instead of doing it in the function `render` (JS, runs on the CPU) since the GPU is specialized in running multiple simple tasks. To communicate to the shader, we need to use `.getUniformLocation` and `.getAttribLocation`. In the code for vertex shader, we have to declare `uniform float t` and `attrib vec4 vPosition`. 

In our JS file:

```js
var colors = [1,0,0, 0,1,0, 0,0,1];
```
In the vertex shader:

```glsl
attribute vec4 vColor;
varying vec4 fColor;
fColor = vColor;
```
In the fragment shader:

```glsl
varying vec4 fColor;
gl_FragColor = fColor;
```


##`.getAttribLocation`
My initial question arose from reading the specs about this method:

> gl.vertexAttribPointer(vPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);

My initial understanding of the code was the following:

```js
// Load data into a buffer
var vertices = [ 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, -0.7, 0.6, 0.9]; //define vertices array
var vBuffer = gl.createBuffer(); //create buffer to be sent
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, vBuffer); //bind the created buffer to gl's ARRAY_BUFFER
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(vertices), gl.STATIC_DRAW); //transform our array object into a pure array, send this data to vBuffer (now bound to ARRAY_BUFFER) with the STATIC_DRAW mode

// Do shader plumbing
var vPosition = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "vPosition"); //retrieve value of attribute called vPosition from program
gl.vertexAttribPointer(vPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0); //have no idea what this is
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(vPosition); //this one either
```

I had no idea what `.vertexAttribPointer` does, so I read the docs (MDN and Khronos - OpenGL, WebGL). Both websites specified that the first argument is a GLuint: 

>**void vertexAttribPointer(GLuint index, GLint size, GLenum type, GLboolean normalized, GLsizei stride, GLintptr offset)** [(OpenGL ES 2.0 §2.8,man page)](https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/2.0/es_full_spec_2.0.25.pdf)

>Assign the WebGLBuffer object currently bound to the ARRAY_BUFFER target to the vertex attribute at the passed index.

That either meant one of the following:

1. vPosition is a GLuint, 
1. WebGL supports some funky abilities that changes an attribute to an integer, 
1. or the method can also take an "attribute vec4" as its first parameter.

I explored the options. I logged vPosition in JS, and it said `0`. Now I was confused. Are `attriubte vec4` variables initialized to 0? If the value of vPosition is 0, when do I ever set its value in the shader? What even is a vec4? What's an attribute? 

I spent a day poking around in the wrong places. `.getAttribLocation` returns the index of the variable, which means it'll be an integer, so attribute vec4 is not initialized to 0. We set the value of vPosition by binding the buffer, putting the value into the buffer, and pointing the data in the buffer to the attribute. vec4 was defined in MV.js as an array? and an attribute is one of several qualifiers that represent storage methods)




So here is the correct interpretation of the code:

```js
// Load data into a buffer
var vertices = [ 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, -0.7, 0.6, 0.9]; //define vertices array
var vBuffer = gl.createBuffer(); //create buffer to be sent
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, vBuffer); //bind the created buffer to gl's ARRAY_BUFFER
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(vertices), gl.STATIC_DRAW); //transform our array object into a pure array, send this data to vBuffer (now bound to ARRAY_BUFFER) with the STATIC_DRAW mode

// Do shader plumbing
var vPosition = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "vPosition"); //retrieves "index" of the said variable.
gl.vertexAttribPointer(vPosition, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0); Vertex data is placed into arrays stored in the client’s address space (described here) or in the server’s address space (described in section 2.9). Blocks of data inthese arrays may then be used to specify multiple geometric primitives through the execution of a single GL command. The client may specify up to MAX_VERTEX_-ATTRIBS arrays specifying one or more generic vertex attributes. The commanddescribes the locations and organizations of these arrays.
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(vPosition);
```


##Buffer Objcets
What are these?

```glsl
/* Buffer Objects */
const GLenum ARRAY_BUFFER                   = 0x8892;
const GLenum ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER           = 0x8893;
const GLenum ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING           = 0x8894;
const GLenum ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING   = 0x8895;

const GLenum STREAM_DRAW                    = 0x88E0;
const GLenum STATIC_DRAW                    = 0x88E4;
const GLenum DYNAMIC_DRAW                   = 0x88E8;

const GLenum BUFFER_SIZE                    = 0x8764;
const GLenum BUFFER_USAGE                   = 0x8765;

const GLenum CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB          = 0x8626;
```

##Sidenotes
- `.bindBuffer` and `.bufferData` should be called often, since it makes it clear to which buffer we're binding our data.
- There are different types of variables - read more below - here are ones you can access from different scopes:

| Variable Type (Qualifier) | Explanation | Example |
| :-----: | :----- | :----- |
| **attribute**             | information that varies from vertex to vertex. Linkage between a vertex shader and OpenGL for per-vertex data. Used in the vertex shader. | coordinate, color |
| **uniform**               | data that is the same for all vertices and fragments. Value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application. Can be used in both vertex and fragment shaders. | time |
| **varying**               | set for vertices in vertex shader, used by interpolation in fragment shader. Linkage between a vertex shader and a fragment shader for interpolated data. Must be declared in both with the same name. | vertex color - fragment color |

##QnA
- In the OpenGL [wiki](https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Vector_constructors), why does the 2nd line work but not the 4th line:

	```glsl
	vec4(vec2(10.0, 11.0), 1.0, 3.5) == vec4(10.0, vec2(11.0, 1.0), 3.5);
	vec3(vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)) == vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
	vec4(vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)); //error. Not enough components.
	vec2(vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)); //error. Too many components.
	```
- what does the `attribute` keyword do in GLSL?

		| Qualifier                       | Meaning       |
		| :-----------------------------: | :------------ |
		| **\<none: default\>**           | local read/write memory, or an input parameter to a function |
		| **const**                       | a compile-time constant, or a function parameter that is read-only |
		| **in or centroid in**           | linkage into a shader from a previous stage, variable is copied in linkage with centroid based interpolation |
		| **out or centroid out**         | linkage out of a shader to a subsequent stage, variable is copied out linkage with centroid based interpolation |
		| **attribute**                   | deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and OpenGL for per-vertex data |
		| **uniform**                     | value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application |
		| **varying or centroid varying** | deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and a fragment shader for interpolated data |
	- Taken and edited from section `4.3.4 Inputs` of the [GLSL spec (1.40.08)](https://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/GLSLangSpec.Full.1.40.08.pdf):
	- For **shaders**: Shader input variables are declared with the in storage qualifier or the centroid in storage qualifier. They form the input interface between previous stages of the OpenGL pipeline and the declaring shader. Input variables must be declared at global scope. Values from the previous pipeline stage are copied into input variables at the beginning of shader execution. Variables declared as in or centroid in may not be written to during shader execution. 
	- For **vertex shaders**: Vertex shader input variables (or attributes) receive per-vertex data. They are declared in a vertex shader with the in qualifier or the deprecated attribute qualifier. It is an error to use centroid in or interpolation qualifiers in a vertex shader input. The values copied in are established by the OpenGL API. It is an error to use attribute in a non-vertex shader. Vertex shader inputs can only be float, floating-point vectors, matrices, signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors. They cannot be arrays or structures. 
	- For **fragment shaders**: Fragment shader inputs (or varyings) get per-fragment values, typically interpolated from a previous stage's outputs. They are declared in fragment shaders with the in storage qualifier, the centroid in storage qualifier, or the deprecated varying and centroid varying storage qualifiers. Fragment inputs can only be signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors, float, floating-point vectors, matrices, or arrays of these. Structures cannot be input. 
- So why are we using old GLSL?
	- WebGL 2.0 is based on OpenGL 3.0, which uses GLSL 1.30.10 I think? The above exerpt is for GLSL 1.40.08.
	- Taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language#Versions) and edited: GLSL versions have evolved alongside specific versions of the OpenGL API. It is only with OpenGL versions 3.3 and above that the GLSL and OpenGL major and minor version numbers match. These versions for GLSL and OpenGL are related in the following table:
