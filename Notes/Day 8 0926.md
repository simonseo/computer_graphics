#Day 8 - More linear algebra!

> Physics is to Calculus as Graphics is to Linear Algebra.

Coordinate frame of point = coordinate system + origin
point = vector + origin

##Singular Matrix
If columns of A are linearly independent, A is singular. Otherwise, A is non-singular. For non-singular matrix, there exists an inverse matrix.
The transformation described by a singular matrix maps multiple points to the same point and thus it is not invertible.

##Linear Transformation and Matrix
Linear transformation: T(ax+y) = aT(x) + T(y)
ex: multiplication by a matrix is a linear transformation
any transformation that moves the origin (0,0) is not linear.

##Homogeneous Coordinate
Homogeneous coordinate: augment coordinates by appending 1 to the original coordinate of points. For vectors, append 0. Translation in 2D becomes a linear transformation in 3D (shearing). With this notation, the vector/point arithmetic has meaning. Point + Point doesn't make sense, 0.5 * (Point + Point) does.
